# lruCache
A LRU cache implemented in C++ for practicing and better understanding the LRU algorithm.  
uses vector to simulate the memory space and LRU queue.

## TODO
- [ ] Finish the test scripts for LRU cache
- [ ] Add FIFO、OPT、CLOCK algorithm for comparison
- [ ] Caculate the time for each algorithm mentioned above
- [ ] improve the code style and runtime for LRU cache
